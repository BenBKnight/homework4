Coding Quiz

## Initial thoughts and room to improve
I unfortunately couldn't work on this as much as I wanted/needed. I was sick with a non-corona virus for the majority of the week. However, when I started feeling better saturday morning, I worked on it til monday evening.  
  
I wasn't able to get a grasp of local storage, and getting the variables to save and display as well as I wanted. I am planning on talking to a TA Monday before/after class and getting more help on that concept. 
  
I initially thought that each question, high-scores, and quiz start were separate html files, but realized we had the tools to make it on one page. So when I changed the view highscores from an anchor tag to a div, it messed up the layout of the header and time. I don't know why it changed and did not want to invest more time into debugging that with my very limited time. 
  
I could not get my timer to stop counting at the end. 

Another thing I would improve given more time is the timer itself. It functions well, but does not stop at zero. It is also bulky. I know there is a more efficient way to write it, especially condensing it into one function.
  
I also think my code is fairly bulky all around. I have onclicks everywhere and two functions per question. I would like to improve my grasp on that.
  
Again, this is not my greatest work and I realize that. I am not giving excuses, more of reasoning of why this isn't my best work. 

## What I think I did well
Despite my subpar work, I was able to make a functioning quiz. This is one of the things I will probably come back and improve. I can say that I did this assignment with minimal outside help.
